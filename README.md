# Propaganda Narrative Analysis

## Overview

We analyze tweets from the PRC embassy in the Phillipines between 
1st January 2020 to 30th June 2021 for propaganda narratives.

We offer some high level computational perspectives on the data to try and 
identify what is being talked about and how it is being talked about.
